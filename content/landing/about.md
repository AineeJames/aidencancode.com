For as long as I can remember, I have been intrigued by technology. My first experience with electronics was when my gradmother got me 
a [Snap Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Circuits) kit for my birthday. For those of you that don't know what these are,
you're missing &mdash; They're basically the Lego version of circuit building. I would sit for hours building the example circuits from
the book.

Later on, in middleschool, I really began to tinker with a [Raspberry PI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) 
using [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) to make some barely playable games. Since I loved to tinker,
I decided to pursue my understanding of technology by attenting Oregon State University (Go Beaves!) for my degree in Electrical and Computer
Engineering &mdash; Graduating in 2023.

When I'm not glued to my desk programming, I enjoy playing video games w/ friends, skateboarding, and spending time with family.
